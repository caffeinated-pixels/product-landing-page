# Product Landing Page (Moonsorrow Industries)

A web page I made for the [Build a Product Landing Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page) freeCodeCamp challenge.

I had a bit of fun with this project, and even cobbled together a video from footage I recorded while playing Elite: Dangerous.

I've now reworked the landing to better work on mobile displays, including adding in a responsive menu. Everyone loves a burger button!
